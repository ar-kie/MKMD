# MKMD
RNA-seq analysis of the MKMD data published in the mdpi journal Nutrients



There are two folders pertaining to two major analysis steps performed:
1. Separate DESeq2 analyses of the three time-points
2. WGCNA network construction of all three time-points combined

For reproducibility and testing of the steps involved in these analyses, we have included the workspaces resulting from prior analysis steps (e.g., full co-expression network for further network analysis).

All data for complete replication are included in this repository. Please be sure to check version packages in the official manuscript.
